stuff people are working on or want to work on so it's easier not to forget:

FRANK
fixing gen.cpp to work with non-constant numbers, that means:
  combining separate files/classes to work together
  maybe changing function signatures to take widths etc as inputs

LACHLAN
converting decimal to binary


AFZAL
menus and inputs
